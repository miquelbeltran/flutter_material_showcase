# flutter_material_showcase

Material Design components showcase for Flutter apps.

This project is based on Ataul's [Material Design Components Showcase](https://github.com/ataulm/material-design-components-showcase) Android project, but for Flutter!

You can use this Flutter package to preview your `ThemeData` and see how it looks like with different Material Widgets.

## Usage

Add the `MaterialShowcase` Widget somewhere in your app:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Flutter Demo',
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: Scaffold(
    body: MaterialShowcase(),
  ),
);
```

You can also add individual component sections to your project for preview like `MaterialShowcaseButtons()` widget. For complete list of available widgets, checkout `lib/components` folder.

If you have custom themed widgets, you can also preview them in the showcase by adding `MaterialShowcaseSection` in  `customSections` property:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Flutter Demo',
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: Scaffold(
    body: MaterialShowcase(
      customSections: [
        // You can add multiple sections here
        MaterialShowcaseSection(
          title: 'Custom Widget Section 1',
          child: CustomWidget(),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
);
```

Then play with the different parameters in `ThemeData` and see how it looks like.
